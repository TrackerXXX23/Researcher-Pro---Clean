# Researcher Pro Backend - Quick Start Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you get started with the Researcher Pro backend implementation. The backend is built with FastAPI and includes a comprehensive set of development tools and utilities.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Node.js 18+

## Getting Started

1. **Clone and Setup**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd researcher-pro-clean

# Set up development environment
./scripts/researcher.py setup verify
./scripts/researcher.py setup init development
```

2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
./scripts/researcher.py venv create
./scripts/researcher.py venv install --dev

# Install Git hooks
./scripts/researcher.py hooks setup
```

3. **Configure Environment**
```bash
# Initialize configuration
./scripts/researcher.py config init development

# Apply configuration
./scripts/researcher.py config apply development
```

4. **Start Development Server**
```bash
# Run the development server
./scripts/researcher.py dev run --reload
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Code Quality**
```bash
# Run code quality checks
./scripts/researcher.py hooks check --fix

# Run tests
./scripts/researcher.py dev test
```

2. **Database Management**
```bash
# Check database connection
./scripts/researcher.py db check

# Run maintenance tasks
./scripts/researcher.py db maintain
```

3. **Monitoring**
```bash
# Start monitoring
./scripts/researcher.py monitor start

# Check system health
./scripts/researcher.py monitor check
```

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Implementation**
