df# Production Build Plan for Researcher Pro

## 1. Environment Setup

1. Ensure all necessary environment variables are set:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For AI analysis
   - `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for the production database
   - `NODE_ENV`: Set to 'production'
   - `PORT`: Set the port for the custom server (default is 3000)
   - Any other required API keys or secrets

2. Use a `.env` file for local development and secure environment variable storage for production (e.g., GitHub Secrets, Vercel Environment Variables).

## 2. Database Migration

1. Review and update the Prisma schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`) if necessary.
2. Generate a new migration:
   ```
   npx prisma migrate dev --name production_ready
   ```
3. Apply the migration to the production database:
   ```
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

## 3. Building the Application

1. Install all dependencies (including dev dependencies for the build process):
   ```
   npm ci
   ```

2. Generate Prisma client:
   ```
   npx prisma generate
   ```

3. Build the Next.js application:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

## 4. Testing

1. Run unit tests:
   ```
   npm run test
   ```

2. Run end-to-end tests:
   ```
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

3. Run the full test suite:
   ```
   npm run test:full
   ```

4. Test report generation:
   ```
   npm run test:report
   ```

5. Perform manual testing of critical flows:
   - Data processing
   - AI analysis
   - Report generation
   - Real-time updates via Socket.IO

## 5. Linting and Type Checking

1. Run ESLint:
   ```
   npm run lint
   ```

2. Ensure TypeScript compilation succeeds:
   ```
   tsc --noEmit
   ```

## 6. Deployment

1. Choose a deployment platform that supports custom Node.js servers (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean)

2. Set up continuous deployment from your main branch

3. Configure production environment variables on the deployment platform

4. Deploy the application:
   - For manual deployment:
     ```
     NODE_ENV=production ts-node --project tsconfig.server.json server.ts
     ```
   - Consider using a process manager like PM2:
     ```
     pm2 start npm --name "researcher-pro" -- start
     ```

5. Verify the deployment by accessing the production URL and testing key functionalities, including Socket.IO real-time updates

## 7. Post-Deployment

1. Monitor application performance and error rates

2. Set up logging and alerting for critical errors
   - Consider implementing a more robust logging solution (e.g., Winston, Bunyan) to replace console.log statements in server.ts

3. Regularly review and update the AI model and analysis process as needed

4. Schedule regular database backups

5. Plan for scaling as the user base grows:
   - For horizontal scaling, consider using a Redis adapter for Socket.IO to manage connections across multiple server instances

## 8. Ongoing Maintenance

1. Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities

2. Monitor OpenAI API usage and costs

3. Continuously improve the AI analysis based on user feedback and new requirements

4. Regularly review and optimize database queries and indexes

5. Keep the Next.js framework and other major dependencies up to date

6. Periodically run and review the results of:
   - `npm run test:e2e:headed` for visual inspection of e2e tests
   - `npm run test:e2e:slow` for debugging complex interactions
   - `npm run test:e2e:debug` for step-by-step debugging of e2e tests

## 9. Custom Server and Socket.IO Considerations

The application uses a custom server (`server.ts`) with Socket.IO integration. Ensure that:

1. The deployment platform supports custom server configurations for Next.js applications.

2. Socket.IO is properly configured:
   - Review CORS settings in the Socket.IO setup. The current configuration allows all origins, which may not be suitable for production.
   - Ensure Socket listeners are correctly set up using the `setupSocketListeners` function.

3. Error handling is robust:
   - The server includes global error handlers for unhandled rejections and uncaught exceptions.
   - These handlers log errors but do not exit the process, ensuring the server continues running.

4. If using a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx), configure it to properly handle WebSocket connections for Socket.IO.

5. Set up SSL/TLS for secure connections, especially important for WebSocket security.

By following this production build plan, you'll ensure that the Researcher Pro application, including its custom server and Socket.IO integration, is properly built, tested, and deployed for production use. Remember to adapt this plan as needed based on your specific infrastructure and requirements.
