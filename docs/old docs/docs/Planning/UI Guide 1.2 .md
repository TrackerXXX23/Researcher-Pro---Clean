## Overview
The enhanced Researcher Pro application aims to provide an advanced, intelligent, and dynamic user experience for financial analysts. The frontend design focuses on delivering a feature-rich interface that leverages AI models like GPT-4, Claude, and the Perplexity API to offer deep insights, customizable analyses, and interactive reporting tools.

## Application Architecture
- **Frontend Framework**: React (with Next.js for server-side rendering and routing)
- **State Management**: Redux (for global state) and Context API (for localized state)
- **UI Component Library**: Material-UI (MUI) or Ant Design (for consistent styling and ready-made components)
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS (using styled-components or MUI's styling solution)
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebSockets (using Socket.IO) or Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Data Visualization**: D3.js or Recharts (for interactive charts and graphs)
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests; Cypress or Playwright for end-to-end tests
