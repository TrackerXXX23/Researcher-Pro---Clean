# TypeScript Error in Data Processing

## Issue Description

We are encountering a TypeScript error in the `dataProcessing.ts` file. The error occurs when trying to pass the `category` parameter to the `generatePrompts` function from the `advancedPCMClientAIPromptGenerator`. 

The error message is:

```
Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type '"acquisition" | "retention" | "tax_strategy" | "product_innovation"'.
```

This error suggests that TypeScript is interpreting our `category` variable as a general string, rather than the specific union type expected by the `generatePrompts` function.

## File Contents

### dataProcessing.ts

```typescript
import { advancedPCMClientAIPromptGenerator } from './advancedPCMClientAIPromptGenerator';
import { aiAnalysisService } from '../services/aiAnalysisService';
import prisma from '../lib/prisma';
import { ProcessedData, AnalysisResult } from '../interfaces';

type Category = 'acquisition' | 'retention' | 'tax_strategy' | 'product_innovation';
type LegalJurisdiction = 'Canada' | 'Saskatchewan' | 'Federal and Provincial';
type IndustryFocus = 'Agribusiness' | 'Technology' | 'Resource Sector' | 'General';
type StrategyType = 'Insurance' | 'Charitable Giving' | 'Business Structure' | 'Investment';

export async function processData(): Promise<ProcessedData[]> {
  const category = 'acquisition' as const;
  const clientSegment = 'high net worth individuals';
  const legalJurisdiction = 'Canada' as const;
  const industryFocus = 'Technology' as const;
  const strategyType = 'Investment' as const;

  const prompts = advancedPCMClientAIPromptGenerator.generatePrompts(
    category,
    clientSegment,
    legalJurisdiction,
    industryFocus,
    strategyType
  );
  // ... rest of the function
}
```

### advancedPCMClientAIPromptGenerator.ts

```typescript
// ... other imports and interfaces

class AdvancedPCMClientAIPromptGenerator {
  // ... other methods

  public generatePrompts(
    category: 'acquisition' | 'retention' | 'tax_strategy' | 'product_innovation',
    clientSegment: string,
    legalJurisdiction: 'Canada' | 'Saskatchewan' | 'Federal and Provincial',
    industryFocus?: 'Agribusiness' | 'Technology' | 'Resource Sector' | 'General',
    strategyType?: 'Insurance' | 'Charitable Giving' | 'Business Structure' | 'Investment'
  ): string[] {
    // ... method implementation
  }

  // ... other methods
}

export const advancedPCMClientAIPromptGenerator = new AdvancedPCMClientAIPromptGenerator();
```

## Analysis

The error occurs because TypeScript is not recognizing that our `category` constant in `dataProcessing.ts` is of the specific union type required by `generatePrompts`. 

We've tried several approaches to resolve this issue:

1. Using type assertions
2. Defining a custom type guard
3. Using `as const` assertions

However, none of these approaches have resolved the error.

## Possible Solutions to Investigate

1. Check if there are any type definition files (`.d.ts`) that might be interfering with our type definitions.
2. Verify that the TypeScript version being used supports the syntax we're using.
3. Investigate if there's any issue with how the `advancedPCMClientAIPromptGenerator` is being imported or if its types are being correctly exported.
4. Consider using an enum for the category type instead of a union type, which might be more explicitly recognized by TypeScript.

## Next Steps

1. Review the `tsconfig.json` file to ensure all necessary options are correctly set.
2. Check for any circular dependencies that might be causing unexpected behavior.
3. Try creating a minimal reproduction of the error in a separate file to isolate the issue.
4. Consider using the TypeScript Playground to test different approaches and see if the error persists in a controlled environment.

Your expertise in resolving this TypeScript error would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if you need any additional information or context to diagnose and resolve this issue.
