# Jest and TypeScript Configuration Troubleshooting Log

## Current Status (as of last update)

We are experiencing issues with Jest parsing TypeScript files, particularly with ES module syntax. Despite several configuration changes, the problems persist.

## Steps Taken

1. Updated `jest.config.js` to use `ts-jest` preset for ESM.
2. Modified `tsconfig.json` to ensure compatibility with ES modules.
3. Updated test files to use ES module import/export syntax.
4. Attempted to use `jest-ts-webcompat-resolver` to resolve module issues.

## Current Issues

1. Jest is unable to parse import statements in TypeScript files.
2. Error messages indicate unexpected tokens and syntax errors in test files.
3. The `as jest.Mock` type assertions are causing parsing issues.

## Next Steps to Consider

1. Consider switching from `ts-jest` to Babel for transpilation.
2. Review and potentially update the Babel configuration.
3. Ensure all necessary Babel presets are installed (e.g., @babel/preset-env, @babel/preset-typescript, @babel/preset-react).
4. Review the project's overall TypeScript configuration to ensure it's compatible with Jest and the testing environment.
5. Consider creating a minimal reproduction of the issue to isolate the problem.

## Error Examples

1. SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module
2. Unexpected token expected "" in various test files

We will continue to investigate these issues and update this log as we make progress.
