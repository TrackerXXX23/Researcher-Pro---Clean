# Development Testing Log

## Overview
This log tracks the progress, changes, and notes related to the development testing process of the Researcher Pro application.

## Log Entries

### Entry: 2023-10-21 15:30

#### Tasks Completed
1. Updated VerticalProgressFlow component to handle edge cases (undefined or empty flows)
2. Implemented comprehensive unit tests for VerticalProgressFlow component
3. Updated VerticalProgressFlow test files to properly mock axios.get calls
4. Added test cases for various scenarios, including when no progress data is available
5. Ran all tests successfully

#### Components Modified
- VerticalProgressFlow

#### Files Modified
- src/components/VerticalProgressFlow.tsx
- src/components/tests/VerticalProgressFlow.test.tsx
- src/components/tests/VerticalProgressFlow.integration.test.tsx
- src/components/tests/VerticalProgressFlow.perf.test.tsx

#### Test Results
- Test Suites: 10 passed, 10 total
- Tests: 28 passed, 28 total
- Snapshots: 0 total
- Time: 25.147 s

#### Notes
- The VerticalProgressFlow component now handles edge cases properly
- Test coverage for VerticalProgressFlow has been significantly expanded
- All tests are passing, indicating improved reliability of the component

#### Warnings and Future Improvements
1. Some warnings about updates not being wrapped in act():
   - Action: Consider wrapping more asynchronous operations in the tests with act() in future updates

#### Next Steps
1. Address the act() warnings in the VerticalProgressFlow tests
2. Implement more integration tests to ensure proper data flow from the API to the VerticalProgressFlow component
3. Update the development testing plan to include the new testing procedures for VerticalProgressFlow

### Entry: 2023-10-20

#### Tasks Completed
1. Implemented VerticalProgressFlow component for visualizing development progress
2. Created DevelopmentFlowsAndProgress.md to track development steps
3. Developed API route for fetching development progress data
4. Integrated VerticalProgressFlow component into the main application page

#### Components Added/Modified
- VerticalProgressFlow (new component)
- Main application page (updated to include VerticalProgressFlow)

#### Files Added/Modified
- src/components/VerticalProgressFlow.tsx (new file)
- src/pages/api/development-progress.ts (new file)
- docs/development/DevelopmentFlowsAndProgress.md (new file)
- src/app/page.tsx (modified)

#### Notes
- The VerticalProgressFlow component provides a visual representation of the development progress
- DevelopmentFlowsAndProgress.md serves as a central location for tracking development steps
- The new API route parses the markdown file to provide progress data to the frontend

#### Next Steps
1. Implement unit tests for the VerticalProgressFlow component
2. Add integration tests to ensure proper data flow from the API to the component
3. Update the development testing plan to include testing procedures for the new progress tracking feature
4. Continue updating the DevelopmentFlowsAndProgress.md as development progresses

### Entry: 2023-10-19

#### Tasks Completed
1. Reviewed and updated the development testing plan
2. Set up the testing environment
   - Installed necessary dependencies
   - Configured Jest for TypeScript and React testing
3. Fixed issues with ProcessManager and AIAnalysisService tests
4. Ran all tests successfully

#### Test Results
- Test Suites: 7 passed, 7 total
- Tests: 18 passed, 18 total
- Snapshots: 0 total
- Time: 20.5 s

#### Components Tested
- ProcessManager
- AIAnalysisService
- (Other components covered by the test suites)

#### Notes
- All components are now functioning as expected according to our test cases
- The application's test suite is in a good state, providing confidence in the codebase's functionality

#### Warnings and Future Improvements
1. Deprecated `punycode` module:
   - Action: Replace with a suitable alternative in future updates
2. Deprecated ts-jest configuration under `globals`:
   - Action: Update Jest configuration to use the recommended approach

#### Next Steps
1. Address the warnings mentioned above in the next maintenance cycle
2. Continue to expand test coverage for other components and services
3. Implement integration tests to ensure components work well together
4. Set up continuous integration to run tests automatically on each commit
