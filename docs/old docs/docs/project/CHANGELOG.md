- Created unit tests for AdvancedPCMClientAIPromptGenerator
- Fixed issue with date placeholder replacement in prompt generation

### Phase 3: Integration with Perplexity API
- Implemented generatePrompts function in perplexityApi
- Created unit tests for perplexityApi
- Updated perplexityApi tests to handle different prompt templates

### Phase 4: Data Processing and Categorization
- Implemented enhanced data categorization and prioritization in dataProcessing.ts
- Added category and priority fields to ProcessedData interface
- Created unit tests for dataProcessing module
- Implemented separate dataCategorization.ts file for categorization and prioritization functions
- Created unit tests for dataCategorization module
- Modified processData function to include categorization and prioritization logic
- Refactored data categorization and prioritization logic into separate utility functions

### Phase 5: Unit Testing and Integration
- Added unit tests for AdvancedPCMClientAIPromptGenerator in advancedPCMClientAIPromptGenerator.test.ts
- Integrated AdvancedPCMClientAIPromptGenerator into the main application flow
- Implemented error handling and logging for template loading and prompt generation
- Refactored and fixed dataProcessing.test.ts to correctly mock promptGenerator
- Ensured all tests are passing, including dataProcessing, advancedPCMClientAIPromptGenerator, dataCategorization, and perplexityApi

### Current State of the Project
- All core functionalities (prompt generation, data processing, API integration) are implemented
- Comprehensive unit tests and E2E tests are in place and passing for all major components
- The project structure is well-organized with clear separation of concerns
- Error handling and logging mechanisms are implemented
- Real-time process flow updates are now visible in the UI
- New documentation provides clear guidance on running and updating E2E tests, troubleshooting, and environment setup
- The application is ready for final integration testing and potential deployment

Next steps:
- Conduct final integration testing to ensure all components work together seamlessly
- Gather user feedback and make any necessary adjustments
- Prepare for deployment and create any additional documentation for users and developers
- Implement caching mechanisms where appropriate to reduce API calls
- Continuously update and expand E2E tests as new features are added

These changes represent significant progress in the development of the Researcher Pro application, with robust prompt generation, data processing, analysis capabilities, and comprehensive testing now in place.
