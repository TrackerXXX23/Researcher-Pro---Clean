# New Dashboard/UI Implementation Log

## Overall Goal
To implement a new dashboard for the Researcher Pro application, replacing the old one with a more modular and feature-rich interface.

## Current Task
Implementing and integrating various components of the new dashboard, including:
- ResearchProcessManager
- NewAnalysisButton
- ReportHistory
- SuggestedAnalyses
- TrendingTopics
- AnalysisTemplates
- SystemPerformance

## Progress So Far
1. Created a new `src/app/page.tsx` file to serve as the main dashboard component.
2. Implemented individual components for each dashboard section.
3. Updated `tsconfig.json` to include necessary compiler options for React and Next.js.

## Current Issues
1. TypeScript errors related to JSX compilation:
   - Cannot use JSX unless the '--jsx' flag is provided.
   - Module resolution issues for component imports.
2. Potential misconfigurations in `tsconfig.json` or `next.config.js`.

## Files of Interest
- `src/app/page.tsx`: Main dashboard component
- `src/components/dashboard/*.tsx`: Individual dashboard components
- `src/components/ui/*.tsx`: UI components used across the dashboard
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration
- `next.config.js`: Next.js configuration

## Current Test Being Run
Running TypeScript compiler check on `src/app/page.tsx`:
```
npx tsc --noEmit src/app/page.tsx
```

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verify that all necessary dependencies are installed (React, Next.js, etc.).
2. Double-check `tsconfig.json` settings, particularly:
   - `"jsx"` option (should be set to "preserve" for Next.js)
   - `"esModuleInterop"` flag (should be set to true)
   - Correct path aliases
3. Ensure that `next.config.js` is properly configured for TypeScript and any custom webpack settings.
4. Verify that all imported components exist and are correctly exported.
5. Check for any mismatches between the TypeScript version specified in `package.json` and the globally installed version.

## Next Steps
1. Resolve JSX compilation issues by adjusting TypeScript and Next.js configurations.
2. Address any remaining import/export issues with components.
3. Once TypeScript errors are resolved, test the dashboard rendering in a browser.
4. Implement any missing functionality in individual components.
5. Add proper error handling and loading states.
6. Implement data fetching logic for each component.
7. Add unit and integration tests for the new dashboard and its components.

## Notes for Future Development
- Consider using a UI component library to streamline development and ensure consistency.
- Implement proper state management (e.g., React Context, Redux) if the dashboard becomes more complex.
- Ensure accessibility standards are met for all new UI components.
- Optimize performance, especially for data-heavy components like ReportHistory.
- Consider implementing code splitting and lazy loading for better initial load times.
- Regularly update dependencies to ensure security and access to new features.
