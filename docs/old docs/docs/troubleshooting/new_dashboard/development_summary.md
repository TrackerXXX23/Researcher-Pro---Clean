# New Dashboard Development Summary

## Project Overview

We are in the process of implementing a new dashboard for the Researcher Pro application. This dashboard aims to provide a more modular, feature-rich, and user-friendly interface compared to the previous version.

## Current State

1. **Components Created:**
   - ResearchProcessManager
   - NewAnalysisButton
   - ReportHistory
   - SuggestedAnalyses
   - TrendingTopics
   - AnalysisTemplates
   - SystemPerformance

2. **Main Dashboard File:**
   - Location: `src/app/page.tsx`
   - Status: Created but facing compilation issues

3. **UI Components:**
   - Basic UI components have been created in `src/components/ui/`

## Challenges Faced

1. **TypeScript and JSX Compilation Issues:**
   - JSX flag not recognized
   - Module resolution problems

2. **Component Integration:**
   - Difficulties in properly importing and using the created components in the main dashboard file

3. **Configuration:**
   - Potential misconfigurations in `tsconfig.json` and `next.config.js`

## Next Steps

1. **Resolve TypeScript/JSX Issues:**
   - Follow the steps outlined in `typescript_jsx_troubleshooting.md`
   - Verify and update `tsconfig.json` and `next.config.js`

2. **Component Refinement:**
   - Once compilation issues are resolved, review and refine each component
   - Ensure proper props are passed and used
   - Implement error handling and loading states

3. **Data Integration:**
   - Implement data fetching logic for each component
   - Set up proper state management (consider using React Context or Redux)

4. **Testing:**
   - Develop unit tests for individual components
   - Create integration tests for the dashboard as a whole
   - Perform thorough manual testing

5. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Implement code splitting and lazy loading where appropriate
   - Optimize rendering of data-heavy components (e.g., ReportHistory)

6. **Accessibility:**
   - Ensure all components meet WCAG guidelines
   - Perform accessibility audit and make necessary improvements

7. **Documentation:**
   - Update component documentation
   - Create user guide for the new dashboard features

8. **Review and Refactor:**
   - Conduct code reviews
   - Refactor code for improved readability and maintainability

## Resources

- Implementation Log: `docs/troubleshooting/new_dashboard/implementation_log.md`
- TypeScript/JSX Troubleshooting Guide: `docs/troubleshooting/new_dashboard/typescript_jsx_troubleshooting.md`
- Project Requirements: Refer to the original PRD document

## Timeline

- Resolve TypeScript/JSX issues: 1-2 days
- Component refinement and data integration: 3-5 days
- Testing and performance optimization: 3-4 days
- Accessibility improvements and documentation: 2-3 days
- Final review, refactoring, and bug fixes: 2-3 days

Total estimated time: 2-3 weeks

## Conclusion

The new dashboard implementation is facing some initial hurdles, primarily related to TypeScript and JSX compilation. However, with the troubleshooting steps outlined and a clear path forward, we expect to overcome these challenges and proceed with the development. The modular approach taken in creating separate components will ultimately lead to a more maintainable and scalable dashboard for Researcher Pro.
