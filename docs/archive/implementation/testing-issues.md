# Testing Issues and Solutions

## Current Status (Updated)

### Dependencies ✅
- axios
- @radix-ui/react-progress
- openai
- jest and related testing packages

### Configuration ✅
- Jest configuration updated
- Test setup file created
- Mocks for external services added

### Resolved Issues ✅

1. Type Safety
- ResearchData interface aligned between interfaces/index.ts and utils/dataProcessing.ts
- AnalysisResult interface updated to match actual implementation
- Timestamp type standardized to string throughout
- Added missing interfaces (AnalysisOptions, ErrorResponse)
- Custom MockChatCompletion type for OpenAI responses

2. Service Implementation
- Private methods properly protected with TypeScript modifiers
- Methods in AIAnalysisService updated with proper TypeScript definitions
- Error handling implemented throughout service
- Added proper return types for all methods
- Retry mechanism implemented and tested

3. Mock Implementation
- OpenAI mock updated to match the actual OpenAI API structure
- Success and error cases handled in mocks
- Mock responses properly typed
- Jest mock types properly configured

### Test Coverage Improvements ✅

1. AIAnalysisService
   - ✓ Basic success case for analysis
   - ✓ API error handling
   - ✓ Retry mechanism on temporary failures
   - ✓ Invalid response format handling
   - ✓ Successful result aggregation
   - ✓ Empty results handling
   - ✓ Failed analysis results handling
   - ✓ Summary generation failure

2. Coverage Metrics
   - Statements: 91.11%
   - Branches: 55.17%
   - Functions: 100%
   - Lines: 90.9%

### Edge Cases Tested ✅

1. Error Handling
   - API failures
   - Invalid response formats
   - Empty result sets
   - Failed analysis results
