feat(analysis): Implement AI-powered market analysis pipeline

This commit implements a comprehensive AI-powered market analysis system that
combines Perplexity API for research and OpenAI API for structured analysis.

Key Features:
- Integrated Perplexity API using llama-3.1-sonar-huge-128k-online model
- OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo for structured analysis and insights
- RESTful API endpoints for analysis management
- Persistent storage with JSON serialization
- Background task processing for async operations
- Detailed progress tracking and status updates

Technical Details:
- AI Service:
  * Perplexity API for market research with structured prompts
  * OpenAI API for JSON-formatted analysis
  * Error handling and logging for API calls

- Analysis API:
  * RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
  * File-based persistence with datetime handling
  * Background task processing using asyncio
  * Progress tracking (0% -> 25% -> 50% -> 100%)

- Documentation:
  * Current implementation status
  * API usage examples
  * Next steps and known issues
  * Environment setup guide

Testing:
- Verified API endpoints functionality
- Tested AI service integration
- Confirmed persistence across server restarts
- Validated JSON serialization fixes

Next Steps:
1. Add WebSocket support for real-time updates
2. Implement frontend visualization components
3. Add error retry mechanism
4. Implement rate limiting
5. Add API key validation
